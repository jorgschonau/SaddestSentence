# SaddestSentence

This is a continuation of my first attempt at sentiment analysis, which was also my final project for Ubiqum Code Academy.

The purpose is to analyse a number of books on a sentence level and to identify the happiest, angriest, most positive, and of course also the saddest sentence.

### Most Negative Sentence

So far, the most sombre sentence is from the book Catch 22:

>His meditations were polluted with threats of dread diseases like Ewing’s tumor and leukemia; he saw his infant son die two >or three times every week because he had never taught his wife how to stop arterial bleeding; watched, in tearful, >paralyzed silence, his whole family electrocuted, one after the other, at a baseboard socket because he had never told her >that a human body would conduct electricity; all four went up in flames almost every night when the water heater exploded >and set the two-story wooden house afire; in ghastly, heartless, revolting detail he saw his poor dear wife’s trim and >fragile body crushed to a viscous pulp against the brick wall of a market building by a half-wined drunken automobile >driver and watched his hysterical five-year-old daughter being led away from the grisly scene by a kindly middle-aged >gentleman with snow-white hair who raped and murdered her repeatedly as soon as he had driven her off to a deserted >sandpit, while his two younger children starved to death slowly in the house after his wife’s mother, who had been baby->sitting, dropped dead from a heart attack when news of his wife’s accident was given to her over the telephone.
