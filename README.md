# SaddestSentence

This is a continuation of my first attempt at sentiment analysis, which was also my final project for Ubiqum Code Academy.

The purpose is to analyse a number of books on a sentence level and to identify the happiest, angriest, most positive, and of course also the saddest sentence.

### Output

You will find a summary of the top & min 50 sentences per method [here](https://github.com/jorgschonau/SaddestSentence/blob/master/files/top50_sentimentr.csv)

### Most Negative Sentences

So far, the most sombre sentence is from the book Catch 22:

>His meditations were polluted with threats of dread diseases like Ewing’s tumor and leukemia; he saw his infant son die two or three times every week because he had never taught his wife how to stop arterial bleeding; watched, in tearful, paralyzed silence, his whole family electrocuted, one after the other, at a baseboard socket because he had never told her that a human body would conduct electricity; all four went up in flames almost every night when the water heater exploded and set the two-story wooden house afire; in ghastly, heartless, revolting detail he saw his poor dear wife’s trim and fragile body crushed to a viscous pulp against the brick wall of a market building by a half-wined drunken automobile driver and watched his hysterical five-year-old daughter being led away from the grisly scene by a kindly middle-aged gentleman with snow-white hair who raped and murdered her repeatedly as soon as he had driven her off to a deserted sandpit, while his two younger children starved to death slowly in the house after his wife’s mother, who had been baby-sitting, dropped dead from a heart attack when news of his wife’s accident was given to her over the telephone.

Followed by this sobering verdict from Crime and Punisment:

>And she had destroyed herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....

An hounorable mention goes to Pulp Fiction:

>This shit is between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'- the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in- agonizing-pain, mr. rapist here.
