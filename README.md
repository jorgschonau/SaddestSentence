# SaddestSentence

This is a continuation of my first attempt at sentiment analysis, which was also my final project for Ubiqum Code Academy.

Books being used:

* Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
* Atomised
* Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,
* 1984
* Crime and Punishment
* Post Office
* Ham on Rye
* All three books of Lord of the Ring: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King
* All Quiet on the Western Front
* Catch 22
* The Call of Cthulhu
* The Dark Tower
* Fahrenheit 451
* Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde
* Siddharta
* The Old Man and the Sea
* Thus Spake Zarathustra
* The Trial
* The Little Prince
* Treasure Island
* Slaughterhouse 5
* At the Mountains of Madness
* Collection of Edgar Allan Poe Stories
